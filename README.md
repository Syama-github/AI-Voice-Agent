## Conversational AI Voice Agent

An AI-powered voice-first conversational agent that can listen, understand, and respond — all in real-time.
Built as part of my #30DaysOfVoiceAgents challenge by Murf AI, this project combines speech recognition, large language model reasoning, and text-to-speech synthesis into a smooth, voice-driven experience.

## Overview

This application allows you to speak naturally into your microphone, have your speech transcribed into text, send that text to a Large Language Model (LLM) for processing, and get a human-like audio reply instantly.

It supports multi-turn conversations with memory, meaning it remembers context from previous interactions during your session.

The UI is minimal, clean, and functional — optimized for quick, fluid conversations without distractions.
